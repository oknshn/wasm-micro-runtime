# Thesis Example

This project is built using **CMake**, a cross-platform build system generator. CMake helps manage the build process in an operating system and compiler-independent manner, making it easier to organize and build large projects.

## Project Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a wasm application that showcases use of library functions which are optimized for embedded systems.


```bash

./build.sh # Compile wasm application and convert to wasm.h then copy to fw for use.

```
